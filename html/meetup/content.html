			<h2>Randomdata on Meetup</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We needed a new way of reaching out to people with a possible interest in hackerspace activities. During a meeting some members decided that a wiki, IRC and flyers at the local university were not enough. So now we have a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Randomdata/">Meetup account</a>. And it works quite well. Aside for some spam and bot accounts.</p> 
   <p>So if you want to attend to a workshop, feel free to reserve a seat on the Meetup page. We appreciate it if you let us know when you decided to not show up, this allows somebody else to fill your place.</p>
